Achieving a buffer size of 128 frames in Firefox for WebAudio latency is straightforward with the following steps:

1. Launch Firefox.
2. Enter about:config in the address bar.
3. Locate the parameter media.cubeb_latency_mtg_frames.
4. Create a new configuration entry, selecting Number as the type, and set its value to 128.
5. Reload all applications or simply restart Firefox to apply the changes effectively.

Please note that when I mention the "address bar," I am referring to the input field at the top of the browser where website addresses (URLs) are entered, as opposed to the search bar typically found on search engine homepages like Google.
